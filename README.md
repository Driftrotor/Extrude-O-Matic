I created this tool after some discusion on the Voron discord.
A tool that uses a Digital Caliper to Calibrate you extruder more accurately.

I set about getting my design ideas down to work towards...
- minimal or no fixings required
- simple easy prints
- must be possible to use without cutting filament

with these i have come up with something that should work reasonably well.
- it has a slot in the top where the bowden tube can be inserted, ensuring you dont need to thread the filament through afterwards.
- the Shuttle has a wiggle path for the filament to run in (this allows the filament to grip the shuttle) and is also slotted so that at the end of each test extrude the filament can be taken out and the shuttle reset, all without having to cut the filament.
- the Shuttle can be inserted at the starting point but afterward it is held captive for the rest of the length.
- the shuttle has some cleaver geometry to grip the end of the depth guage on the Calipers (a mirrored version is also included)
- the Shuttle guide is made for a push fit for the end of your caliper ensuring a firm hold
